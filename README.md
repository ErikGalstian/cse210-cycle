# Cycle
Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.

## Getting Started
---
Check to see if your computer is running Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 and Python 3.8.0 or later. By launching a terminal and entering the following command, you can install Raylib Python CFFI.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
Once the necessary libraries have been installed, use a terminal and navigate to the project's root folder. Run the following command to launch the program. 

```
python3 cycle
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- cycle               (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
